# hello-world
NOOB101 will try and learn something today
hey, i have no real experience in any form of programming at all. my aim is to get a better understanding of all this and try change the way i make a living. 
I am currently workng as an all around electrician in australia, i can see the way the industry is currently headed and will most likely end up in the not too distant future. i would really like to get the upper hand on using the software that creates the programs and ideas behind automatiom.
